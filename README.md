# Ditto
An Easy to Use Programming Language

# What it is
Ditto is a programming language whose syntax is very similar to English, making it easy to learn. It's best used as an introduction to the world of coding, by allowing newbie coders to construct code in an intuitive manner before moving on to learning proper syntax. 

# How it works
Ditto accomplishes this by parsing the English text that the user writes and converting it into Javascript code that can run conventionally. By using Javascript, Ditto can also take advantage of its libraries to familiarize the user with their functions in a welcoming environment.
